As Team 5, we will create website about museums in US. We will organize the museums with their types. For example, historical, science, art and, space etc. We will introduce the museums, their prices, their photographs, their addresses, when they have built, their visitor ratings and, we will have a survey that result will show you which museum you should go and see.
